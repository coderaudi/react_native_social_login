1. go to firebase and create your application 
2. provide all the details and download the google-service.json
3. add google-service.json to root of andorid/app 
4. go to npm and install npm i @react-native-community/google-signin --save

// npm is depend on the RN vesion 
// how to check RN version got to package .son and check for react-native
// in my case its  "react-native": "0.63.2"
// so which is helpful for me => @react-native-community/google-signin

For RN >= 0.60 please use version 3 installed from @react-native-community/google-signin
For RN <= 0.59 use version 2 installed from react-native-google-signin

// before going to componenet level we need to make some changes depending to andorid

// url to follow => https://github.com/react-native-community/google-signin/blob/HEAD/docs/android-guide.md

8. there are few changes in settings.gradle and mainapplication.java done by the linking.

9. Update android/build.gradle with

buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "27.0.3"
        minSdkVersion = 16
        compileSdkVersion = 27
        targetSdkVersion = 26
        supportLibVersion = "27.1.1"
        googlePlayServicesAuthVersion = "16.0.1" // <--- use this version or newer
    }
...
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.2' // <--- use this version or newer
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.1.0' // <--- use this version or newer
    }
...
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        google() // <--- make sure this is included
        jcenter()
        maven {
            // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
            url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
        }
    }
}



10.  Update android/app/build.gradle with

...
dependencies {

    // impt for google signin 
   //  implementation(project(":react-native-google-signin"))  only when RN <60

    // 
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
    implementation "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1"
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"
    implementation 'androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:1.0.0' // <-- add this; newer versions should work too
}

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // <--- this should be the last line


11.  at the time of linking setting.gradle updated so check below lines are there


include ':react-native-google-signin', ':app'
project(':react-native-google-signin').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@react-native-community/google-signin/android')


12. android/app/serc/main/java/MainApplication.java  check the mainapplication.java file 

 // import is there 

import co.apptailor.googlesignin.RNGoogleSigninPackage;


//   new RNGoogleSigninPackage()  
// no need to add in the package because we used react-native link ==> so its addeded by autoliking


// to clean in case error or unable to compile

cd android
./gradlew clean
now react-native run-android
